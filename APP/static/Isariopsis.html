                    <h2><b>Grape___Leaf_blight_(Isariopsis_Leaf_Spot)</b></h2>
                    <p>Grape___Leaf_blight_(Isariopsis_Leaf_Spot) is undoubtedly one of the most damaging pathogens of Grape, and it
                        limits production of Grape in many tropical and subtropical areas of the world. It is also a
                        problem in many countries that have a Mediterranean climate such as California. Thus, the spread
                        of the virus throughout California must be considered as a serious potential threat to the
                        Grape industry.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div data-aos="fade-up">
                    <h2><b>Cause</b></h2>
                    <p>There are a number of factors why it has not yet spread to all the major Grape-producing areas
                        of California, including the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys. First, its vector, Bemisia
                        whitefly species are not typically found in these Grape-producing areas because it is
                        intolerant of winter temperatures there. Second, the Central Valley's winter season provides a
                        'natural' Grape-free period, which usually goes from late November through early February.
                        Although the virus can infect other plants, Grape is the host in which it builds-up most
                        quickly. Thus, by having an annual 'Grape-free period', it is likely that the amount of viral
                        inoculum (as well as whitefly populations) will be significantly reduced by the time the Grape
                        planting season starts again in late winter-early spring. This would mean that, even if the
                        virus is able to overwinter, it may take a long time to reach levels that cause economic damage.
                        <br>
                        Grape yellow leaf curl virus is a geminivirus (family Geminiviridae). Although it can infect a
                        relatively wide range of plant species, Grape is the host to which the virus is best adapted
                        and that facilitates the build-up of the virus to high incidences in the field. Other hosts
                        include solanaceous crops, which may develop symptomless infections, and weeds (e.g., nightshade
                        and jimsonweed).
                        <br>
                        In addition, the virus causes leaf curl in certain varieties of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris)
                        and the ornamental plant lisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorum). A range of weeds from other families
                        can be infected by this virus, but most of these do not develop obvious disease symptoms. It is
                        not known how well whiteflies acquire the virus from symptomless hosts. However, it has been
                        hypothesized that these hosts serve as a 'bridge' for the virus in the absence of Grape crops,
                        and that perennial weeds help allow the virus to become permanently established.

                    <h2><b>Symptoms</b></h2>
                    <p>
                        Grape yellow leaf curl is a disease of Grape caused by Grape yellow leaf curl virus. Infected
                        Grape plants initially show stunted and erect or upright plant growth; plants infected at an
                        early stage of growth will show severe stunting. However, the most diagnostic symptoms are those
                        in leaves.

                        Leaves of infected plants are small and curl upward; and show strong crumpling and interveinal
                        and marginal yellowing. The internodes of infected plants become shortened and, together with
                        the stunted growth, plants often take on a bushy appearance, which is sometimes referred to as
                        'bonsai' or broccoli'-like growth. Flowers formed on infected plants commonly do not develop and
                        fall off (abscise). Fruit production is dramatically reduced, particularly when plants are
                        infected at an early age, and it is not uncommon for losses of 100% to be experienced in fields
                        with heavily infected plants.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Select TYLCV-resistant varieties.
                        </li>
                        <li> Use virus- and whitefly-free transplants.
                        </li>
                        <li>DO NOT import Grape (or any potential whitefly host) transplants from areas known to have
                            the virus.
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Plant immediately after any Grape-free period or true winter season.
                        </li>
                        <li> Avoid planting new fields near older fields (especially those with TYLCV-infected plants).
                        </li>
                        <li>Manage WHITEFLIES.
                        </li>
                        <li> Cover plants with floating row covers of fine mesh (Agryl or Agribon) to protect from
                            whitefly infestations.
                        </li>
                        <li>Rogue diseased plants when incidence of virus infection is low.</li>
                        <li>
                            Practice good weed management in and around fields to the extent feasible.

                        </li>
                        <li>A voluntary or enforced regional host-free period in areas lacking a true winter season
                            (i.e., temperatures low enough to prevent crop cultivation and whitefly survival) might be a
                            useful management tool. The crops to be included in a region will depend on the
                            agroecosystem.
