                    <h2><b>Septoria Leaf Spot (Mycosphaerella Graminicola)</b></h2>
                    <p>Septoria leaf spot is a very common disease of tomatoes.It is caused by a fungus (Septoria
                        lycopersici) and can affect tomatoes and other plants in the Solanaceae family, especially
                        potatoes and eggplant, just about anywhere in the world. Although Septoria leaf spot is not
                        necessarily fatal for your tomato plants, it spreads rapidly and can quickly defoliate and
                        weaken the plants, rendering them unable to bear fruit to maturity.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div data-aos="fade-up">
                    <h2><b>Cause</b></h2>
                    <p>Fungus spores are very good at hiding out and waiting for ideal conditions. They can travel great
                        distances, in hopes of finding those conditions. The Septoria lycopersici fungus lives on the
                        fallen tomato plant debris and weeds that are on and in the soil, and it can overwinter. It is
                        spread to the plants by water splashing up on the plants from the soil, as well as insects,
                        people, and equipment that come in contact with the fungus. Warm (60 to 80 F), humid conditions
                        are the most favorable for Septoria leaf spot to develop, and that's when you should be most
                        watchful. If caught early, it can be controlled.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div data-aos="fade-up">
                    <h2><b>Symptoms</b></h2>
                    <p>Septoria leaf spots start off somewhat circular and first appear on the undersides of older
                        leaves, at the bottom of the plant. They are small, 1/16 to 1/8 inches (1.6 to 3.2 millimeters)
                        in diameter, with a dark brown margin and lighter gray or tan centers. A yellow halo may
                        surround the spot.

                        As the disease develops, the spots will get larger and may merge together. If you view them
                        through a magnifying lens you may see the fruiting bodies of the fungus, which look like dark
                        brown pimples. This is one of the symptoms that distinguish Septoria leaf spot from other leaf
                        spotting diseases.​

                        <br>

                        Although the symptoms usually occur in the older, lower leaves, the disease can develop at any
                        stage in the tomato plant's life.They may also appear on the stems as well as the blossoms
                        and calyxes. One small bit of good news—they rarely affect the fruits.


                        If untreated, Septoria leaf spot will cause the leaves to turn yellow and eventually to dry out
                        and fall off. This will weaken the plant, send it into decline and cause sun scalding of the
                        unprotected, exposed tomatoes. Without leaves, the plant will not continue producing and
                        maturing tomatoes. Septoria leaf spot spreads rapidly.
                    </p>


                </div>

                <div data-aos="fade-up">
                    <h2><b>Management & Control</b></h2>
                    <p>You probably won't be able to avoid Septoria leaf spot altogether. It is very widespread and,
                        given the ideal conditions, it will try to take hold in your garden. However, there are some
                        precautions you can take to lower the likelihood that Septoria leaf spot will occur.</p>


                    <p>
                        <b>Start with a clean garden: </b>Dispose of all affected plants. The fungus can over-winter on
                        the debris of diseased plants. It's important to dispose of all the affected plants far away
                        from the garden and the compost pile. Keep in mind that it may have spread to your potatoes and
                        eggplants, too.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Avoid overhead watering. </b>Water aids the spread of Septoria leaf spot. Keep it off the
                        leaves as much as possible by watering at the base of the plant only. Of course, it's impossible
                        to keep the rain off your plants, but every little bit helps.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Provide room for air circulation: </b>Leave some space between your tomato plants so there
                        is good airflow. Stake them so that they are not touching the ground and not all bunched
                        together. Good air circulation is especially important during damp and rainy periods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Mulch below the plants: </b> A layer of mulch will help prevent spores on the ground from
                        splashing up onto the lower leaves.
                    </p>

                    <p>There are a few options for treating Septoria leaf spot when it appears; these include:</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Removing infected leaves: </b> Remove infected leaves immediately, and be sure to wash your
                        hands and pruners thoroughly before working with uninfected plants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Consider organic fungicide options: </b>Fungicides containing either copper or potassium
                        bicarbonate will help prevent the spreading of the disease. Begin spraying as soon as the first
                        symptoms appear and follow the label directions for continued management..
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Consider chemical fungicides: </b> While chemical options are not ideal, they may be the only option for controlling advanced infections. One of the least toxic and most effective is chlorothalonil (sold under the names Fungonil and Daconil).
                    </p>
